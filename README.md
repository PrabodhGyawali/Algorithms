This Repo contains a bunch of projects to learn using algorithms. {Goal is to get 4 to 5 months of project work}

Repository 1: Maze Generating Algorithms in C and C++
- Algorithm 1: Depth First Search Algorithm -> Deadline: 2 weeks
- Algorithm 2: Prim's Algorithm -> Deadline: 2 weeks
...

Future projs: A* algorithm, computer vision related algorithms:

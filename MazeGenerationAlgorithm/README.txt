- https://github.com/ferenc-nemeth/maze-generation-algorithms

### Maze Generators:
- Aldous Border
- Binary tree
- Kruskal
- Prim's
- Recursive Backtracking
- Recursive Division

### Running a Maze generator:
>`python3 -m venv .venv`
>`./.venv/bin/python3 install -r "requirements.txt"`
>`make && ./maze_app > output.txt && ./.venv/bin/python3 animation/ocv_python/animate.py`

Maze Solvers:
- Dead-end filling
- Dijkstra's
- Wall follower

Animations: FINAL TEST
- OpenCV python as GTK is super annoying to configure



Performance tests
- for various maze sizes

Goals:
- Learn about algorithms by implement C++ structured code in C
- Learn OpenCV python for animation and computer vision algorithms

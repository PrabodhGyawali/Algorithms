Implementing from:
- https://github.com/ferenc-nemeth/maze-generation-algorithms

Maze Generators:
- Aldous Border
- Binary tree
- Kruskal
- Prim's
- Recursive Backtracking
- Recursive Division

Maze Solvers:
- Dead-end filling
- Dijkstra's
- Wall follower

Goals:
- Implement in C++ to C by translation
- Go from C to C++ -> Memory and C++ best practices
